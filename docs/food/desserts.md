## Schenkeli

ca. 100 min, for 16 pieces

### Ingredients

- 50g butter, soft
- 90g sugar
- 2 pinches of salt
- 1 lemon
- 0.5 tbsp cherry liqour (optional, I guess. use water otherwise)
- 200g gf flour mix (I used once Schär universal and Schär bread mix. Both worked out fine)
- 0.5 tsp baking soda
- 1 tsp fibre husk
- oil for frying

### Instructions

- mix butter, sugar and salt, add eggs and mix well until it's light in color and slightly "airy".
- add lemon zest with liquor, mix.
- mix flour, baking soda, fibre husk separately. combine the dry and wet components (do not knead the dough. should be mixed well enough and be sticky.)
- put dough for at least 1hour in fridge.
- part dough in about 16 pieces and "roll" them into about 5cm (ca 2 inch) long pieces. Ends should be a little thinner.
- fry them in oil at 175°C (347 F) for 2 to 2.5 min on each side until they are a beautiful brown color. let them drain and cool on paper towel.
