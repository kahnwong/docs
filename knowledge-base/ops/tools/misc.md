### fish_config

<https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/1916>

- viewing the temp file fish creates to see what port the webserver is bound to (I had 8000)
- opening a second ssh session and tunneling the port to localhost. example:
  `ssh -L 8000:localhost:8000 user@host`
- opening my browser to the link referenced in the temp file.
