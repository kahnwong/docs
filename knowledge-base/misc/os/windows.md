## Windows network share

In Windows 10. Go to credential manager (click start and type "credential manager" or find it in control panel), click windows credentials and in windows credentials add your server share address with username and password. If you cannot see the share, just type your server and share address in the windows address field: `\server name\share name` or `\192.198.x.x\share name`.
